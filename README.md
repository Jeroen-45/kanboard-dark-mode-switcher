# Kanboard Dark mode Switcher
A simple plugin for Kanboard that adds a button to switch between dark and light modes. Created to work with the [Greenwing](https://github.com/p0lym0rphik/Greenwing) theme, untested with others. Feel free to create a PR to add support for other themes, probably by adding to the dark mode CSS.

## Prerequisites
- Kanboard >= 1.0.35

## Installation
You have the choice between 2 methods:

1. Download the zip file and decompress everything under the directory `plugins/DarkModeSwitcher`
2. Clone this repository into the folder `plugins/DarkModeSwitcher`

Note: Plugin folder is case-sensitive.

## Usage
Open the user menu on the top right, then click "Switch to dark mode"/"Switch to light mode" to change modes. The current mode is saved individually for each user.
